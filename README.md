# CryptoClustering Project: Unveiling Cryptocurrency Price Change Patterns

Greetings! I'm excited to share my CryptoClustering project with you. In this adventure, I dove deep into the world of cryptocurrencies using Python and the power of unsupervised learning. My objective? To gain a profound understanding of how 24-hour and 7-day price changes affect various cryptocurrencies. Let me walk you through my journey:

## My Journey Thus Far
* Exploring the Data: I began by immersing myself in the crypto_market_data.csv dataset, an invaluable source of cryptocurrency insights. Summarizing statistics and creating visualizations allowed me to grasp the data's essence and uncover initial patterns.
* Data Preprocessing: To make my data analysis-ready, I harnessed the capabilities of the StandardScaler() from scikit-learn. This crucial step ensured my data was normalized and ready for more sophisticated analysis.
* Clustering with Original Scaled Data: Armed with normalized data, I employed the elbow method to determine the ideal number of clusters (k) using the original scaled data. This technique allowed me to unveil hidden structures within the dataset. The visual elbow curve helped me pinpoint the best k value.
* K-means Clustering with Original Scaled Data: Armed with the optimal k value, I put K-means clustering to work, grouping cryptocurrencies based on their intrinsic features. Visualizing the clusters offered me insights into how different cryptocurrencies exhibit similar behaviors.
* Optimizing with PCA: Enter Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This technique enabled me to reduce the data's dimensions while retaining meaningful insights. Understanding the explained variance of the principal components guided my analysis in this compressed-feature space.
* PCA Data Clustering: Applying the elbow method on the PCA data, I uncovered the ideal k value for this reduced-feature space. This approach shed a fresh light on clustering patterns.
* K-means Clustering with PCA Data: Armed with the optimal k value from PCA, I revisited K-means clustering on the PCA data. A new scatter plot allowed me to visualize the impact of reduced features on the clustering outcome.

## What Does It All Mean?
My project unveils the intricate relationships between cryptocurrencies and their price changes. By harnessing advanced techniques such as K-means clustering and PCA, I've demystified patterns that might remain concealed at first glance. Through my project, you'll witness the prowess of Python in data analysis and unsupervised learning, offering profound insights into the complex world of cryptocurrencies.

Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast, a cryptocurrency aficionado, or simply curious about how data can unearth concealed stories, my project has something captivating to offer. Join me in exploring this journey, and let's uncover the hidden dynamics of cryptocurrency price changes together. Happy exploration!
